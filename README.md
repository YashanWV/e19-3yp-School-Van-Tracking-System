## Introduction

Our project is a comprehensive School Van Tracking System designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of student school transportation. Employing cutting-edge technology, our solution utilizes real-time GPS tracking to provide parents and administrators with instant visibility into the location of school vans. The system offers a secure and user-friendly mobile application for parents, enabling them to track their child's journey in real-time. Administrators can monitor the entire fleet through a robust web application.

Key features include real time location tracking of school vans and accident monitoring with instant alerts for both parents and administrators, ensuring a prompt response in case of emergencies. The platform also facilitates efficient student data management, allowing multiple parents to register for the same child. With a cloud-based infrastructure, our system ensures scalability, reliability, and data security. Emphasizing user safety, our School Van Tracking System redefines the standards of student transportation management.

## Key Features

### Real Time Tracking

Parents can see the real-time location of their children on the map using our user-friendly mobile app for parents which will ensure their convenience. The parents can see the location of their children from the moment they get on the school bus till their departure from the school rather than worrying about where their children are. 

We also provide real-time location tracking of all the busses of the school transport tratravelling agency which will buy our product via our admin web applcation.

We also provide speed of the bus real time for both admin and client side through the apps to clarify if the driver is driving at appropriate speed throughout a trip. If the driver exceeding speed limits inappropriately admin can take actions on the drivers.  Parents can also complain about the driver to the admin side.

### Accident Alerts

We also provide accident alerts in a paternal manner by taking acceleration readings in three dimensions(directions). If any acceleration happents to any direction that exceedig a predefined threshold value, first an alarm will send to the driver to clarify wich it is an falsy alert and only if the driver couldn't turn off that alarm before a predefined time it will be recognized as a really an accident. 

Then it will alert to the parents rather than keeping them waiting withot providing any information to them about why the bus stopped and in the admin side we are providing a service to the admin side for alerting ambulances via the web application and send the bus's locaton to the ambulance. 

We are planning to do it using registering some ambulance services for our mobile app by creating another type of account for ambulance services. The only functionality for the ambulance service account is that the location of the bus and path to that location using Google Maps will be provided for them. 

Then we provide parents notifications that an ambulance started to serve incase of an accident and provide notifications that the case is served after the ambulance arrived to the location of the bus.
